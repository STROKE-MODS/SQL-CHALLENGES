2. Revenue Leak Investigation

Scenario: Finance reports missing revenue from refunded orders.

    Task: Calculate net revenue (gross sales - refunds) per product, including products with $0 refunds.

        Tables: orders, refunds, products.

        Hint: Use COALESCE() to handle NULL refunds.

3. Supply Chain Optimization

Scenario: Warehouse wants to reduce overstock.

    Task: Identify products:

        Sold <5 times in the last 6 months.

        With >50 units in stock.

5. Dynamic Pricing Model

Scenario: Competitors are undercutting your prices.

    Task: Generate a price adjustment report:

        If a product’s price is 10% higher than the competitor’s average → flag for discount.

        If it’s 20% lower → flag for price increase.

    Task: Flag orders where:

        Billing/shipping country mismatch.

        Order value > $1000 but from a new account (<7 days old).

        Same credit card used across multiple accounts.

7. A/B Test Analysis

Scenario: Did the new checkout page increase conversions?

    Task: Compare conversion rates (orders/visits) between:

        Users who saw layout_v1 vs. layout_v2.

        Segment results by user location (US vs. EU).

8. Inventory Fulfillment

Scenario: Customers complain about delayed orders.

    Task: For each order, calculate:

        Rank suppliers by average delay (worst to best).
